### README for Autonomous-Vehicle-Noise-Measurement-with-Raspberry-Pi

#### Project Overview
This repository contains code for a project aimed at integrating real-time vehicle detection and noise measurement using a Raspberry Pi. The primary goal is to enhance urban monitoring systems by tracking vehicle types and their noise levels in real-time, utilizing a combination of TensorFlow, OpenCV, and audio processing techniques.

#### Contents
- `alevel.py`: Python script for measuring A-weighted sound levels.
- `capture_image.py`: Captures images from the camera for object detection.
- `sound.py`: Processes sound data to compute dB levels.
- `test.py`: Basic script for testing smaller components of the project.
- `version0.py`: Initial version of the integration for vehicle detection and sound measurement.
- `detections.jpg`, `test.jpg`: Sample outputs from the object detection process.

#### Setup and Installation
To set up and run this project on your Raspberry Pi, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Autonomous-Vehicle-Noise-Measurement-with-Raspberry-Pi.git
   cd Autonomous-Vehicle-Noise-Measurement-with-Raspberry-Pi
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python 3 installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Running the scripts:**
   To start the vehicle detection and noise measurement, run:
   ```bash
   python alevel.py
   ```

#### Usage
1. **Vehicle Detection:**
   - `capture_image.py` utilizes OpenCV to capture video frames which are processed by TensorFlow models to detect vehicles.
   - Detected vehicles and their types (car, truck, bus) are highlighted in the output frames.

2. **Sound Measurement:**
   - `sound.py` captures audio through the Raspberry Pi's microphone, processes the data to compute dB levels using A-weighting filters, and displays the sound levels in real-time.

3. **Combining Video and Audio Processing:**
   - `version0.py` integrates the vehicle detection and sound measurement scripts to function simultaneously, providing a holistic view of both visual and auditory information.
